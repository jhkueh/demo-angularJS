A News Client built in AngularJS 
=================================

This App, based on @codealpha's [tutorial](https://coderwall.com/p/0pfmvq) & [code](https://github.com/codealpha/hn-angular), uses AngularJS to fetch the top 20 posts from [Ocy's Wiki](http://ocy1357.appspot.com/) (my GAE site), and display them on the page.
